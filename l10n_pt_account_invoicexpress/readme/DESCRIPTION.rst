Generate Portuguese tax authority legal Invoices ("Faturas") using InvoiceXpress.

InvoiceXpress is a paid service, although free trials are available.
Visit https://invoicexpress.com for more details.

Once the InvoiceXpress connection is configured,
the invoice CONFIRM button automatically generates the InvoiceXpress invoice.

If the InvoiceXpress Invoice email template is configured,
the InvoiceXpress service will also send the invoice by email,
using the details in Odoo configured email template.

This replaces the Odoo SEND & PRINT button,
since only the InvoiceXpress generated document should be used.
Having other print layouts for the invoice is not allowed
by the Portuguese Tax Authority.

Legal transport documents ("Guias de Transporte") are also supported
through the extension module "l10n_pt_stock_invoicexpress".
