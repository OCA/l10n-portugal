On an Invoice, the CONFIRM button automatically generates
an invoice on the InvoiceXpress service.

The "Email InvoiceXpress" button requests the InvoiceXpress service to send an email with a
copy of the legal document.

The Invoice form shows an "InvoiceXpress" tab containing details for
the corresponding InvoiceXpress document.
