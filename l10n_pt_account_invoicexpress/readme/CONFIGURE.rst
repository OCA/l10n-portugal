To configure:

- Navigate to Settings/General Settings.
- In the "General Settings" configuration section, locate the "InvoiceXpress" subsection:
  There you can set:

  - InvoiceXpress Account Name
  - InvoiceXpress API Key
  - InvoiceXpress Invoice Email Template

The email template is used to prepare the details for the email the InvoiceXpress
service sends with the invoice:

- "To" email address
- "Cc" email address
- Subject
- Body

Translations are supported, and the customer language is used to render
the email details.

The InvoiceXpress configuration is per company,
and can also be modified directly on the Company form,
if the Developer Mode is enabled.

On the Journal form, for sales journals, a flag is available to allow disabling
the InvoiceXpress integration. This can be useful for a journal that was used temporarily
to import invoice history, for reporting purposes, ond was then disabled,
or to allow that journal to use a different legal invoicing system.

Note that all invoices generated MUST use a certified invoicing system.
For a portuguese company, you cannot have some of the invoices being generated by Odoo
itself. So use this option at your own risk, and only in the cases you are sure
to be compliant with TPortugues Tax Authority invoicing regulations.
