Generate Portuguese tax authority legal Invoices ("Faturas") using InvoiceXpress.

**UPDATE November/2021:**

Invoices:

- Added support to the different documents types:
  Invoice, Invoice Receipt, Simplified Invoice and VAT MOSS.
  The default document type is set on the Journal,
  and can be changed on the Invoice form.

- Use the invoice commercial partner for the name and address,
  instead of the invoice contact.

- Added support for the Terms and Conditions/Observations field

- Added to Credit Notes the link to the source Invoice


InvoiceXpress is a paid service.
Visit https://invoicexpress.com for more details.

Once the InvoiceXpress connection is configured,
the invoice CONFIRM button automatically generates the InvoiceXpress invoice.

If the InvoiceXpress Invoice email template is configured,
the InvoiceXpress service will also send the invoice by email,
using the details in Odoo configured email template.

This replaces the Odoo SEND & PRINT button,
since only the InvoiceXpress generated document should be used.
Having other print layouts for the invoice is not allowed
by the Portuguese Tax Authority.

Legal transport documents ("Guias de Transporte" e "Guias de Remessa) are also supported
through the extension module "l10n_pt_stock_invoicexpress".

Configuration
=============

To configure:

- Navigate to Settings/General Settings.
- In the "General Settings" configuration section, locate the "InvoiceXpress" subsection:
  There you can set:

  - InvoiceXpress Account Name
  - InvoiceXpress API Key
  - InvoiceXpress Invoice Email Template

The email template is used to prepare the details for the email the InvoiceXpress
service sends with the invoice:

- "To" email address
- "Cc" email address
- Subject
- Body

Translations are supported, and the customer language is used to render
the email details.

The InvoiceXpress configuration is per company,
and can also be modified directly on the Company form,
if the Developer Mode is enabled.

On the Journal form, for sales journals, a flag is available to allow disabling
the InvoiceXpress integration. This can be useful for a journal that was used temporarily
to import invoice history, for reporting purposes, ond was then disabled,
or to allow that journal to use a different legal invoicing system.

Note that all invoices generated MUST use a certified invoicing system.
For a portuguese company, you cannot have some of the invoices being generated by Odoo
itself. So use this option at your own risk, and only in the cases you are sure
to be compliant with TPortugues Tax Authority invoicing regulations.

Usage
=====

On an Invoice, the CONFIRM button automatically generates
an invoice on the InvoiceXpress service.

The "Email InvoiceXpress" button requests the InvoiceXpress service to send an email with a
copy of the legal document.

The Invoice form shows an "InvoiceXpress" tab containing details for
the corresponding InvoiceXpress document.
